# Resume-Classification-and-Job-recommendation
An NLP-powered job recommendation engine that classifies resumes using KNN, Naive Bayes, and RNN models. Deployed as a live web application with Flask on Render, achieving 98.45% accuracy.

## 1. Introduction
In the modern job market, recruiters are often inundated with thousands of resumes for a single job opening. Manually sorting through these documents to find qualified candidates for various roles is a time-consuming and inefficient process. This project addresses this challenge by developing an intelligent system that automates the classification of resumes into predefined job categories and provides relevant job recommendations. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, this system serves as a powerful tool to streamline the initial stages of the recruitment process.
